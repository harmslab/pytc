    Wrapper that creates a BaseITCExperiment instance that that holds an ITC
    experiment and the model that describes it.  It looks at "dh_file" and 
    decides which kind of parser to use. 

    Parameters
    ----------

    dh_file: string
        integrated heats file written out by origin software.
    model: ITCModel subclass instance
        ITCModel subclass to use for modeling
    shot_start: int
        what shot to use as the first real point.  Shots start at 0, so
        default=1 discards first point.
    units : string
        file units ("cal","kcal","J","kJ") 
    uncertainty : float > 0.0
        uncertainty in integrated heats (set to same for all shots, unless
        specified in something like NITPIC output file). 
 
    **model_kwargs: any keyword arguments to pass to the model.  Any
                    keywords passed here will override whatever is
                    stored in the dh_file.
