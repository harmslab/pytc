==================
pytc documentation
==================

A python software package for analyzing Isothermal Titration Calorimetry data.
The name is a `portmanteau <https://xkcd.com/739/>`_ of Python and ITC.  

Introduction
============

`pytc <https://github.com/harmslab/pytc>`_ is python software used to extract
thermodynamic information from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
experiments.  It fits arbitrarily complex thermodynamic models to multiple ITC
experiments simultaneously.  We built it with three design principles:

 + **Open source and cross platform**. The full source code should be available.
   The program should not require proprietary software to run. 
 + **Ease of use**. Fitting basic models should be easy.  Implementing completely
   new thermodynamic models should be straightforward. 
 + **Accessible for users and programmers**.  It should have both a GUI and a 
   well-documented API. 

Our implementation is built on `python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ extended with  `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ 
and `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_.   The GUI is built on `pytq5 <http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html>`_.

Features
========

 + Rigorous fitting using least squares, bootstrap, and Bayesian approaches.
 + Clean, pythonic API
 + Simple, cross-platform GUI based on `PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_.
 + New thermodynamic models can be defined using a few lines of python code.
 + Easy integration with `jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks for 
   writing custom fitting scripts.

API Quick Start
===============

If you already have a python3-based scientific computing environment installed, 
you can start using the API by:

.. sourcecode ::

    # Install pytc
    sudo pip3 install pytc-fitter

    # Clone the repo (to bring in demos)
    git clone https://github.com/harmslab/pytc-demos

    # Fire up jupyter and work through the demos
    cd pytc-demos
    jupyter notebook


Example code using the API
==========================

Fit a :math:`Ca^{2+}/EDTA` binding experiment to a single-site binding model.

.. sourcecode:: python

    import pytc

    # Load in integrated heats from an ITC experiment
    e = pytc.ITCExperiment("demos/ca-edta/tris-01.DH",
                           pytc.indiv_models.SingleSite)

    # Create the global fitter, add the experiment, and fit
    g = pytc.GlobalFit()
    g.add_experiment(e)
    g.fit()

    # Print the results out
    g.plot()
    g.corner_plot()
    print(g.fit_as_csv)
